# tsab_pico
PICO-8 style API module for [tsab](https://github.com/egordorichev/tsab)

# Usage
You will need compiled [tsab](https://github.com/egordorichev/tsab).
Create a new folder. Copy the contents of this repository to it, and run tsab in the directory.

**Goal of this project is not to recreate PICO-8 or give you more freedom on the code (well, you can use require and hidden tsab stuff, but still), but to make it easy to port PICO-8 carts over tsab and add useful API to them, such as Steam API and other.**
